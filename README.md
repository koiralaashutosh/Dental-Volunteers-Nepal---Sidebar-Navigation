# Dental Volunteers Nepal - Sidebar Navigation
This is a simple implementation of a sidebar navigation menu for a hypothetical NGO, Dental Volunteers Nepal. The project was created to test how a side menu can be integrated into a website using HTML, CSS, and Font Awesome icons. The design includes smooth transitions, hover effects, and a responsive layout.

This project was built for learning purposes and can be modified or expanded as needed.
